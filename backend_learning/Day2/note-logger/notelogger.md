# 🚀 Full Stack Journey — Day 2: Node.js Core Modules & Mini Project

## 📚 Topics Covered

On **Day 2**, we explored the core modules of Node.js, which are the built-in tools Node provides without any installation.

### 🧱 Core Modules Learned:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `fs` (File System) | To read and write files (e.g., saving notes) |
| `path`             | To manage file/directory paths (cross-platform safe) |
| `os`               | To get system information like memory, CPU, platform |
| `url`              | To parse the browser’s URL and extract query parameters |
| `events`           | To create and handle custom events like logging |
| `http`             | To create your own web server from scratch |

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks (Before Project)

Before building the project, I practiced and understood each module individually.

### ✅ `fs` Module
- Created a file and wrote text to it.
- Appended more data.
- Read the contents of the file.

### ✅ `os` Module
- Displayed platform name using `os.platform()`.
- Displayed free memory with `os.freemem()`.

### ✅ `path` Module
- Used `path.join()` to combine file paths safely.
- Learned about `__dirname` to get current directory path.

### ✅ `url` Module
- Parsed URLs like `http://localhost:3000/add-note?title=Hello&content=World`
- Extracted `title` and `content` using `url.parse()`.

### ✅ `events` Module
- Created an event emitter.
- Listened for a custom event like `'note-added'`.
- Triggered the event when a new note was added.

## 💡 Mini Project: `note-logger`

A simple app to:
- Add a note (via URL)
- Save it to a file
- Log the event when the note is added
- View system info like memory, CPU

### 📁 Project Structure

```
note-logger/
├── app.js          # Main app file
├── logger.js       # Handles custom events
├── notes.txt       # Stores all added notes
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### ▶ `app.js`
1. Create a basic HTTP server.
2. Accept notes via the `/add-note` route using query parameters.
3. Append the note to `notes.txt` using `fs`.
4. Emit an event using our custom `logger`.
5. Provide `/sysinfo` route to show system info using `os`.

### ▶ `logger.js`
- A simple event emitter that logs a message when a new note is added.

## 🌐 How to Use

1. **Start the server:**
```bash
node app.js
```

2. **Add a note using browser:**
```
http://localhost:3000/add-note?title=Hello&content=This%20is%20a%20note
```

3. **Check the file:**
- Open `notes.txt` to see saved notes.

4. **See System Info:**
```
http://localhost:3000/sysinfo
```

## ✅ What I Learned

- The **importance of each core module** in building real apps.
- How to create a **basic logging system** using events.
- How to handle file writing securely with `fs` and `path`.
- That even without any framework, **Node.js can do a lot!**

## 💭 Next Step: Day 3
> Introduction to Express.js & Basic Routing  
Much easier and cleaner than the raw `http` module!
